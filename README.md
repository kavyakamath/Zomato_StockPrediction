Zomato Stock Price Prediction Model

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the closing price of Zomato's stock based on historical data. The model utilizes various features such as open price, close price, high price, low price, and volume to forecast future stock prices.

Features
Historical data of Zomato's stock price, including:
*Date
*Open Price
*Close Price
*High Price
*Low Price
*Volume

The stock prediction model is based on the Linear Regression technique, which is a simple yet effective method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (closing price) and one or more independent variables (features). The model is trained on historical data and used to make predictions for future dates.

Usage
To use the Zomato stock prediction model:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary historical data of Zomato's stock price in a CSV file format.
2. Prepare the data and preprocess it according to the requirements of the model.
3. Train the linear regression model using the prepared data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or future dates.
